# Data Science Salaries
Data science is a diverse, rapidly evolving field. Considering the variance in data scientistsâ€™ roles and salaries, it can be difficult to determine industry standards. This can be problematic for data scientist job applicants during an offer negotiation; when asked their desired pay, they need to have a reasonable idea of what that company might be willing to offer. The goal of this project was to address this issue through the development of a salary-predicting machine learning model.

The model was trained using the ["Glassdoor Data Science Job Listings"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rrkcoder/glassdoor-data-science-job-listings/code) dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset contains 1500 rows of U.S. job listings scraped from Glassdoor.com.
